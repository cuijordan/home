		<p>Everyone's history starts with their birth, and of course, I was no different. I was born in 2006 at North York General Hospital. 
			When I was born, I weighed a hefty 8lbs 8oz or 3.8kg. Shown in the map below is North York General Hospital, where I was born.</p>

		<p>I was born three years after my older brother, the second of two children. For a while I stayed at home, until I was old enough to go to school. From kindergarten
		to grade three I attended Shaughnessy Public School. The school was pretty small, I remember there only being one or two classes per grade. Shown in the
		map below is Shaughnessy Public School.

		<p>After grade three, I attended Seneca Hill Public School's gifted program for two years. Originally I was supposed to stay at Seneca Hill for three years, however,
		during Grade 5, Seneca Hill removed its sixth grade. Once the sixth graders (while I was in grade five) had graduated, there would no longer be a sixth grade at Seneca Hill.
		Shown below is a map of Seneca Hill Public School. </p>

		<p>Since Seneca Hill removed its sixth grade, it also changed feeding schools from J.B. Tyrell to Zion Heights. My class was the first from Seneca Hill to be fed to Zion Heights. Here I spent grades six through eight.
		Shown below is a map of Zion Heights. </p>

		<p>While in seventh grade, I applied to Victoria Park Collegiate Institute's IB program and was accepted. I am now attending school here.
