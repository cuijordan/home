		<!--Paragraph explaining my travels-->
		<p>I love travelling, it's always great to go to new places and meet new people. Most of the travelling that I've done has been through a cruise ship.
		I've been on a cruise four times now, and each time it was great. Cruises are so much fun, unlike a travelling by car or by plane, when you take a cruise
		time spent travelling is just as fun as time spent at your destination. Aboard a cruise there is also great food and lots of activities. 
		Here are some of the places I've been to.</p>
